# Cargo plugin for t3rn composable contracts

[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/paritytech/cargo-contract)](LICENSE) 
[![GitLab Status](https://gitlab.parity.io/parity/cargo-contract/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.parity.io/parity/cargo-contract/pipelines)
[![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/cargo-contract.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-contract)

A CLI tool for helping setting up and managing WebAssembly smart contracts in !ink, Solidity (_not yet! WIP._) and WebAssembly text format. Supports t3rn composable contracts.
 
**This is a fork of [`cargo-contracts`](https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contracts). The fork extends the smart contract languages with Solidity and WASM text format. It also adds the features of composable contract builds, deployment and execution via t3rn gateways.**

## Installation

- **Prerequisites**

  - **rust-src**: `rustup component add rust-src`
  - **wasm-opt**: https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen#tools

- **Install from source**
    - `cargo build --features extrinsics`
- **Install from remote repo**
  - `cargo install --git https://github.com/MaciejBaj/cargo-contract cargo-t3rn-contract --features extrinsics --force`

**You can now use the compiler as a command line tool: `cargo t3rn-contract`**


## Usage

```
cargo-t3rn-contract 0.3.0
Utilities to develop Wasm smart contracts.

USAGE:
    cargo contract <SUBCOMMAND>

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

NEW COMMANDS:
    composable-build       Compiles multiple smart contracts according to schedule
    composable-deploy      Upload the multiple smart contracts chains according to schedule
    call-runtime-gateway   Execute smart contract via Runtime Gateway
    call-contracts-gateway Execute smart contract via Contracts Gateway
    call-contract          Execute smart contract via regular Contract call

SUBCOMMANDS:
    new                    Setup and create a new smart contract project
    build                  Compiles the smart contract
    generate-metadata      Generate contract metadata artifacts
    test                   Test the smart contract off-chain
    deploy                 Upload the smart contract code to the chain
    instantiate            Instantiate a deployed smart contract
    help                   Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
```

## `build` requires the `nightly` toolchain

`cargo contract build` must be run using the `nightly` toolchain. If you have 
[`rustup`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup) installed, the simplest way to do so is `cargo +nightly contract build`.
To avoid having to add `+nightly` you can also create a `rust-toolchain` file in your local directory containing 
`nightly`. Read more about how to [specify the rustup toolchain](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup#override-precedence).

## Features

The `deploy` and `instantiate` subcommands are **disabled by default**, since they are not fully stable yet and increase the build time.

If you want to try them, you need to enable the `extrinsics` feature:

`cargo install --git https://github.com/MaciejBaj/cargo-contract cargo-t3rn-contract --features extrinsics --force`

Once they are stable and the compilation time is acceptable, we will consider removing the `extrinsics` feature.
